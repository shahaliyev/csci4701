# Resources

There are resources which I find helpful for studying deep learning. They are listed below:

[Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, Courville)](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) is a classic book on deep learning. It is systematic and rigorous, especially for core ideas. It is well suited for building long-term foundations and for reading research papers. But it is not up to date with modern practice (e.g. transformers), and it offers little guidance on implementation.

[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) is a modern, code-based book. It is mostly up to date and tightly integrates explanations with runnable code with different frameworks. It covers a wide range of contemporary architectures and techniques. But it is less systematic (perhaps, due to many authors) and less mathematically rigirous.

[Deep Learning: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) by _Andrej Karpathy_ is a lecture series that builds neural networks from backpropagation to transformers from scratch. It demonstrates the implementation of major papers and core concepts in a simple manner.

[Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by _3Blue1Brown_ focuses on visual intuition. It is excellent for forming a general understanding about deep learning. It is technically not heavy and should be treated as a conceptual support.

[Learn PyTorch](https://www.learnpytorch.io/) is a practical guide to PyTorch. It demonstrates how modern deep learning workflows are written and organized in code. It assumes prior understanding of important topics.
