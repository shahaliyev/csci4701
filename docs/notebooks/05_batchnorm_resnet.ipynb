        "Increasing the number of layers in neural networks for learning more advanced functions is challenging due to issues like [vanishing gradients](../04_regul_optim). VGGNet [(Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556)) partially addressed this problem by using repetitive _blocks_ that stack multiple convolutional layers before downsampling with max-pooling. For instance, two consecutive $3 \\times 3$ convolutional layers achieve the same receptive field as a single $5 \\times 5$ convolution, while preserving a higher spatial resolution for the next layer. In simpler terms, repeating a smaller kernel allows the network to access the same input pixels while retaining more detail for subsequent processing. Larger kernels blur (downsample) the image more aggressively, which can lead to the loss of important details and force the network to reduce resolution earlier in the architecture and stop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite this breakthrough, VGGNet was still limited and showed diminishing returns beyond 19 layers (hence, VGG19 architecture). Another architecture was introduced the same year with the paper of the Inception architecture  ([Szegedy et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842)).<span class=\"fn\"><span class=\"fn-body\">It was named <em>Inception</em> because of the <a href='https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-need-to-go-deeper'>internet meme</a> from the infamous <em>Inception</em> movie.

Despite enabling deeper networks with far fewer parameters, Inception did not fully resolve the core training and convergence problems faced by very deep models.\n",

We will now set up the data environment and go on discussing the core ideas and implementations of both papers.

When the dataset is not large, an <code>80 : 10 : 10</code> split is a reasonable ratio for allocation. For larger datasets (e.g. with one million images), it is fine to allocate 95% or more of your data for training. The training set is used to update the model's parameters. The validation set is used for tuning hyperparameters (e.g. testing different learning rates, regularization strengths, etc.).

In the strict sense, a <em>batch</em> refers to the entire training dataset processed in a single update of the model parameters.

In practice, most deep learning libraries use the word <em>batch</em> to mean <em>mini-batch</em>.

Normalization reduces the risk of exploding or vanishing gradients, allowing deeper networks to train effectively.

Instead, many studies indicate that normalization improves the geometry of the optimization problem, producing smoother loss surfaces and better-conditioned gradients.

As a result, the exact mechanism behind the success of batch normalization is still discussed in the literature, although its practical effectiveness is well established.\n",

We may assume that a more powerful model can learn more types of functions and show better performance. But that's not always the case. To achieve a better performance than a simpler model, our model must be capable of learning not only more functions but also all the functions the simpler model can learn. Simply, the possible function class of the more powerful model should be a superclass of the simpler model's function class $\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$.

If some activation nodes in our network are unnecessary and increase complexity or learn bad representations, instead of learning weights and biases, our residual block can now learn an identity function $f(x) = x$ by simply setting that nodes parameters to zero. As a result, our inputs will propagate faster while ensuring that the learned functions are within the biggest function domain. By providing an identity path through which gradients can flow directly across layers, skip connections alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",

To differentiate, you can imagine that dropout blocks the path, while residual connection allows the network to learn more functions by helping inputs to \"jump over\" (skip) the nodes. And it is very important that the function classes of the model with residual blocks is a superset of the same model without such blocks. Hence, residual connections allow the model to represent complex functions while retaining easy access to simpler ones through the identity mapping, which improves optimization and mitigates vanishing gradients."
